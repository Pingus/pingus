Introduction

   Pingus is a free Lemmings(tm) clone for GNU/Linux, Win32 and other
   operating systems supported by ClanLib. It is covered under the GPLv2,
   check the file COPYING, for more information.
   
   See 'INSTALL' for instructions on how to compile and run Pingus from
   source. If you are using the static binary have a look at the file
   README.binary. You might also want to read the file 'FAQ' if you have
   trouble getting things to work.
   
   Music for the game is seperatly available at the Pingus web page.
   
   If you want to help developing Pingus, have a look on its web page:

Mailing Lists

 There are currently two mailing lists available:

    * pingus-devel - A list for discussing development issues, like
      level creation or code changes, but might as well be used for
      user issues like how to solve levels and such

    * pingus-cvs - Read-only list to which all CVS commits get
      submitted, only intersting for developers in general

 For information on how to subscribe to any of these lists have a look at:

IRC

  For a quick help you can try the IRC server irc.freenode.net:6667
  and the channel #pingus, you can find the project maintainer (nick:
  grumbel) there most of the time. From time to time there will also be
  IRC Mettings with larger parts of the development team, once such
  meetings happen, they will get announced in the news section on the
  Pingus webpage.

Bug Reports

   Questions about the game and bug reports should go to pingus-users or
   pingus-devel lists. You may also contact Ingo Ruhnke <grumbel@gmx.de>.
