======

Introduction
------------

Pingus is a free Lemmings(tm) clone for GNU/Linux, Win32 and other
operating systems supported by SDL2. It is covered under the GPL, check
the file COPYING, for more information.

See `INSTALL.linux.md` for instructions on how to compile and run Pingus
from source on GNU/Linux and `INSTALL.macosx.md` for MacOSX.

Information about the game, new versions and additional documentation
can be found at the Pingus webpage:

Mailing Lists
-------------

There are currently two mailing lists available:

* pingus-devel - A list for discussing development issues, like level
  creation or code changes, but might as well be used for user issues
  like how to solve levels and such

* pingus-cvs - Read-only list to which all CVS commits get submitted,
  only intersting for developers in general

For information on how to subscribe to any of these lists have a look
