Pingus BUGS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Editer arrow keys don't work

Duplication doesn't work for entrances

* Pressing Armageddon crashes the game from time to time

* While loading a level it sometimes quits with a message that a
  resource wasn't found, but the resource should be pressent

* Sound Support is very primitive

* Music support isn't much tested

* Zooming is broken

* Some non Critical Errors (file not found, etc.)  quit Pingus, when
  it still should be able to contiune

* Bridger's bridges are put wrongly to the colmap

* Extremly short mouse clicks are not registered (its a bug in
  ClanLibs event system)

* with-extra-libs broken

* sstream buggy, doesn't work with gcc-3.0

* plf entrances are buggy

'grep' at the sources for "Bug" or "FIXME" that should give you some
more known bugs and other stuff. 


Controller:
 * crashes if axis, button etc is not given
 * axis has hangle, but shouldn't have, pointer should handle that
 * axis event has up/down only, should be float -1,1
