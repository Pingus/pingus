What we need before we have a finished game:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* first of we need worldmaps for all different themes we have
* we need connection between the worlds, probally some story text, or
  some cut-scene like images
* we need to solve the problem of pingus stuck in a wall
* we need to fix up all action to work probally in most situations
* we need some more worldobjects

libxml check broken

Platform that only allows some pingus on it

Editor can't handle backgrounds, it can only load and save them.

Editor can't handle worldobj, teleporter and probablly other stuff

> 1.  basher: The basher can go through small solid objects. He does

Release Critical:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Capture Radius of blockers not large enough
 o Bridge building is broken
 o Input handling is broken, the number keys doesn't seem to work
 o Editor reagiert nicht auf Nummern Tastatur
 o Screen border isn't fatal
 o Minner goes throu metal
 o Bridger colmap bug
 o default directory when saving a level
 o Solid can be bashed away if a bridge is placed in it
 o Basher bash thru solid object
 o Exits are not drawn at the correct positions in the small map
 o Resource aren't found from time to time, even if they are present
   (probably a memory problem, time for efence I guess)
 o Miner graebt durch solid
 o Add feature flag to list features compiled into pingus
 o You can scroll when you shoudn't be able to scroll (800x600)
 o bottom tiles aren't displayed
 o climber capturing doesn't work
 o Basher doesn't care about solid objects
 o Change the config file syntax
 o groundpiece type (transparent, ...) editable from the editor
 o verbose level sorting
   0. no output at all, only on segfault and exit
   1. Creation of main game components
   2. other important game events
   3. Loading of data
 o Bridger, if in waiting state, can recive another new action
 o Editor doesn't handle entrance direction!!
 o fix themes
 o Position of cap rect doesn't fit for climber
 o miner and basher needs to be slower
 o *.wav not found erros if sound is disabled.
 o test if put_target() works or where it fails (small surfaces?!)
 o basher isn't falling if he goes over a hole in the ground
 o Splashed can be captured.
 o Bombers with unlimited actions turn crazy
 o z_pos handlig im editor braucht nen fix
 o QuickPlay sollte den Level anzeigen, bzw entfernt werden.
 o Jumper harken sich fest
 o glibc2.1 as requirement auf Pingus site

Probably fixed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Segfault when the quit button is pressed
 o Standard World braucht hoeheren feuer-hintergrund. [anderer hintergrund]
 o Segfaults in CL_MouseCursor...?! [gibt es hwcursor]
 o Mouse Zeiger im Result screen
 o Zerquetschte Pinguine sollten keine Pixel werfen (smasher)
 o Bridger verhacken sich in Waenden
 o Pingus splash even if they are floaters if they were to fast when the
   floater was appied
 o Colmap manipulation for traps, entrances, etc.
 o if level is smaller than screen, no tiles are drawn
 o Sometimes when I make one pingus explode, many others explode.

Wishlist:
~~~~~~~~~
 o Level replay should be possible without reloading
 o Limit liquids to multiples of width, get rid of cliprect stuff
 o Demo Mode/automatisches abspielen von demos 
 o put_target() with alpha channel doesn't work (opace blits)
 o Extrem kleine Maps klappen nicht (overdrawing)
 o ButtonPanel needs to be rewritten/redesigned.
 o Hotkeys fuers Main menu.
 o Wolkenausgang, so dass ne Bruecke zum erreichen benoetigt wird.
 o ClanLibs X11 implementation needs to use X11 events... normal queries
   doesn't work very well... 
 o 'map' might be an reserved keyword
 o cache the level map for a fast restart

Digger  - fixing
Basher  - fixing
Builder - Animation tuning
Blocker - fall throu fixen
Jumper  - Animation?!
Floater - check if killed if falling to height

For 0.3.x
~~~~~~~~~
Rewrite some of the map generation code
Level replays gehen schief
editor, check if file exist before overwriteing it
fixed PgUp/PgDown for zooming
tump nail for level
colmap manipulation for liquid
