      level looks boring, the basic idea is ok, but needs fixing and
      improvements.

      good idea, but a bit short, also its quit obvious due to the
      limited actions. Not sure why we have climbers here.

      not sure if it was really indented, but its extremly hard to get
      the pingus at the start saved, it is possible to build bridges
      to catch them at ~40 out, but that requires quite preciese
      timing. Seperating a single pingu to build the rest will also
      require a bit of timing, but is still possible. The real hard
      part is to build the final bridge to the exit, since one will
      easily run out of bridges there. Anyway if timing is correctly
      this level is solveable, but it might require quite a few
      retries.

      level is to small and interfers with the GUI elements.

      Hm, don't like this one, spikes in the air don't look really
      good, maybe the trap should be replaced with something else.

      the obvious solution isn't the correct one, but on a second

      I don't like the traps that fly in the air or in the ground,
      looks ugly. The basic idea to cross two bridges is cool, but the
      surrounding could be better and less random due to the invisible
      traps.

      freeing the blocker to get 30 saved is a bit hard, beside that
