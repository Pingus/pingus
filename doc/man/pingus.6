.SH DESCRIPTION
Pingus is a side-scrolling puzzle game where the player has to
guide a group of penguins from the entrance of a level to the
exit, in between the path is blocked by numerous obstacles and
dangers that the player has to overcome by assigning actions to
the penguins.
.SH ACTIONS
.TP 
Basher
The Basher will to a horizontal dig, leaving behind it a
tunnel. It is not able to dig through metal.
.TP 
Blocker
The Blocker will stop and stay in position, directing
other penguins to turn around when they reach him.
.TP 
Bomber
The Bomber will blow up on the spot and take a bit of
surrounding ground with it.
.TP 
Bridger
The Bridger will build a small bridge, useful for crossing
small chasm.
.TP 
Climber
The Climber actions allows a Pingu to travel upwards a
vertical wall. Unlike other actions the climber action is
a permanent addition to the Pingus ability.
.TP 
Digger
The Digger will dig a hole into the ground. It can't dig
through metal.
.TP 
Floater
The Floater action will give a penguin a small propeller
that lets him gently glide down from great heights that
would otherwise be deadly.
.TP 
Jumper
The Jumper will let the Pingu do a big leap forward,
allowing him to cross chasm and small vertical obstacles.
.TP 
Miner
The Miner will dig a diagonal hole into the ground.
.TP 
Slider
The Slider will make a tiny leap forward, gliding on its
belly for a short while, allowing the Pingu to make it
through narrow tunnels.

.TP 
-r, --renderer=RENDERER
Use the given renderer, defaults to sdl. Available renderers are:
.RS 
.TP 
sdl
A simple software renderer based on SDL, this
is the default and the safest options.
.TP 
opengl
The OpenGL renderer will use hardware
acceleration to render the graphics, it is much
faster then the SDL renderer and recommended when
the hardware supports OpenGL.
.TP 
delta
The delta renderer uses SDL for rendering and
doesn't use hardware acceleration, it will however
try to increase rendering performance by only re
rendering screen elements that have changed. Using
the delta renderer will disable some effects such
as scrolling background to allow maximum
benefits.
.RE
.TP 
-g, --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT
Set the window resolution for pingus (default:
800x600). Note that \*(T<\fB\-\-geometry\fR\*(T> only
applies to the window resolution, for the fullscreen
resolution
use \*(T<\fB\-\-fullscreen\-resolution\fR\*(T>
.TP 
-R, --fullscreen-resolution=WIDTHxHEIGHT
Set the resolution used in fullscreen mode (default: 800x600)
.TP 
--software-cursor

.SS "GAME OPTIONS"
.TP 
--no-auto-scrolling

will cause the screen to scroll whenever the mouse reaches
the border of the screen. Automatic scrolling will only be
active in fullscreen mode or when mouse-grab is
enabled.
.TP 
--drag-drop-scrolling
Enable drag'n drop scrolling. By default Pingus will
use a rubber-band scrolling where the scroll speed
depends on how far away the cursor is from the position
when the mouse button has been clicked. In drag&drop
mode scrolling will behave more like in traditional GUI
applications such as Gimp, where clicking the scroll
button will 'pick up' the playfield and allow to move it
around till it is released again.
